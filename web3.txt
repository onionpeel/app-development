To use web3.js:
The operating system needs to have visual studio v-2015 and python.  This can be set up by opening the command line as the administrator and then running the command:  npm install --global --production windows-build-tools --vs2015

If this step is not done, there will be an error that shows: node-gyp rebuild

Once this step is done, you can use: npm i web3.js
But for ethereum it is recommended to use: npm i --save web3@1.0.0-beta.46

This allows web3js to be a dependency in react, but it also prevented other dependencies from being installed.
To solve this problem, check to see the error when trying to install a dependency.
It will identify a directory in node_modules.  Go into this module (it was websocket when I did this) and delete the .git folder.
Then the dependency can be installed.
This can be done from the command line, or a script can be created or it can be done manually (I did it manually).

Dapps must get permission from the user in order to connect to that user's blockchain address.
That is done with this line of code, which is run inside of a useEffect() callback:
const account = await window.ethereum.enable();
This causes a privacy notice to pop up and the user has to choose to allow the dapp to access the blockchain and get account details.
