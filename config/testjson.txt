The issue arises when jest is run when using the npm config package.  There needs to be a file called, test.json, inside of the config folder.  Jest will set NODE_ENV to "test" and the config package searches for a file with that name (test.json).

There needs to be an object, {}, inside of test.json.  This is where configuration variables for the test environment are stored.  For example, to specify a certain database for testing purposes (inserting the actual values for X):
{
  "mongoDbUri": "mongodb://XXXXXXX:XXXXXXX@ds129776.mlab.com:29776/vocab-app-testing"
}


From the docs:
https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config/wiki/Strict-Mode
NODE_ENV value of '{NODE_ENV}' did not match any deployment config file names.

If NODE_ENV is set in the environment, we check if there is any file matching that name in the config/ directory containing valid syntax. You can create a file with the name matching the desired NODE_ENV value: {NODE_ENV}.json and include the contents '{}', which is an empty valid JSON object. If you are using YAML based config files, the file {NODE_ENV}.yml must not be empty, place a comment or any valid YAML syntax in the file.
